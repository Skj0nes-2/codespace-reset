Ugh, yellow. Where do I even start with that ass-ugly color? It's the color of sickness, 
of piss, of those godawful smiley faces that people plaster everywhere like some kind of 
forced cheerleading squad for the hopelessly naive. Fuck yellow. It’s like the visual 
equivalent of a nails-on-a-chalkboard screech, just grating on your soul. It’s the color 
of caution tape, you know, like a warning sign that whatever is behind it is probably some 
kind of fucked-up disaster. It reminds me of those cheap plastic toys kids have that break 
after two seconds, all bright and flashy and utterly useless. 

Speaking of useless, you know what else is useless? Trying to find joy in anything when 
the world is just a swirling vortex of bullshit. Like, I tried to be optimistic once. 
Once. Ended up getting hit by a bus. Not even a cool, dramatic bus crash, just a 
slow-moving city bus that barely scratched me but ruined my favorite pair of boots. 
My favorite pair. And they were black, the only decent color in existence. See? Even 
the universe is conspiring against anything that isn't a nauseating shade of yellow. 
Maybe you like yellow, huh? You look like the type who probably owns a "Live, Laugh, Love" 
sign and unironically uses emojis. Get a grip, you sad sack. Life's a bitch, and it ain't 
painted yellow. It's a grimy, mud-colored mess, and the sooner you accept that, the better
off you'll be. Yellow is for assholes who pretend everything is sunshine and rainbows while
the rest of us are drowning in the sewage. Don't even get me started on how it looks on 
clothes. Makes you look like a goddamn oversized banana. Just offensive to the eyes. 
Absolutely offensive.
